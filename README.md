# Sudoku_Solver
This was a project started in C++. I had used this for an assignment for a python Object-Oriented Programming course. 

I soon used this to better understand python and eventually surpassing the progress I had made in C++.

This takes the text file of an unsloved sudoku board, and will return the output of the solved file.
